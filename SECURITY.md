## Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying Tech-citizen-sw-gateway, follow these security guidelines:

### Environment Variables

Never commit these to version control:

```bash
# CRITICAL - Never expose publicly
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<secure-password>

# Use strong, randomly generated values
# Example: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### Database Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for database accounts
- Restrict database access to application server IPs only
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Regular backups with encryption at rest

### Application Security

- **Always use HTTPS** in production (no plain HTTP)
- **Enable CORS** restrictions (whitelist allowed origins)
- **Rate limiting** enabled by default (configurable)
- **Helmet.js** security headers enabled
- **Input validation** with class-validator on all DTOs

### Infrastructure Security

- Keep Node.js and dependencies up to date
- Use container security scanning (e.g., Snyk, Trivy)
- Implement network isolation (VPC, security groups)
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Enable database audit logs (10-year retention for healthcare)

### Healthcare-Specific Security (HIPAA/GDPR)

- **PHI Protection**: Encrypt all patient health information
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with audit trail
- **Data Retention**: 10-year minimum for medical records
- **Breach Notification**: Report breaches within 72 hours (GDPR)
- **Business Associate Agreement**: Required for HIPAA compliance

## Known Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 100 req/min per IP (configurable)
- ✅ **Helmet.js**: Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- ✅ **Input Validation**: class-validator on all endpoints
- ✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: TypeORM parameterized queries
- ✅ **XSS Protection**: Sanitized inputs and outputs
- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: Double-submit cookie pattern
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete event trail (NDJSON format)

### Regular Security Maintenance

We perform regular:

- Dependency vulnerability scans (`npm audit`)
- Static code analysis (ESLint security plugin, SonarJS)
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Third-party security audits (annually)
